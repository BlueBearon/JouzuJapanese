For logging security threats, you typically want to capture information that can help you identify and investigate potential attacks. This can include the client's IP address, the timestamp of the request, the HTTP method and path, and any other relevant details about the request.

Here's an example of how you might modify your `QuestionController` to log this information for each request:

```java
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

// ...

@GetMapping("/api/verbConjugation")
public Map<String, String> getVerbConjugation(@RequestParam Map<String, String> allParams, HttpServletRequest request) {
    // Get the client's IP address
    String clientIP = request.getRemoteAddr();
    // Get the request timestamp
    LocalDateTime requestTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    // Get the HTTP method and path
    String httpMethod = request.getMethod();
    String requestPath = request.getRequestURI();

    // Log the security-related information
    System.out.println("Security Log: " + requestTime + " - Client IP: " + clientIP + " - Method: " + httpMethod + " - Path: " + requestPath);

    // ... rest of your method logic
}
```

This log entry will include the time of the request, the client's IP address, the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.), and the path of the request. This information can be useful for detecting patterns of suspicious activity, such as repeated requests from the same IP address or attempts to access sensitive endpoints.

Remember to handle this information carefully, as it can be sensitive. You should ensure that your logs are stored securely and that access to them is restricted to authorized personnel only. Additionally, consider using a logging framework like Logback or Log4j, which can provide more advanced features like log rotation, filtering, and output to different destinations (e.g., files, databases, or external services).

If you're using Spring Boot, you can also take advantage of Spring Security's auditing capabilities to log authentication events and other security-related information. This can provide a more comprehensive view of security events within your application.
